# Babeltron Architecture

## Overview
Babeltron is a high-performance translation service that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide accurate and efficient translations. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective while delivering high-quality translations across multiple languages.

## System Components and Flow

### 1. Model Download and Initialization
The system supports two primary translation models that are downloaded and initialized during startup:

![Model Download Process](images/1_download.png)

#### M2M100 (418M)
- A multilingual model capable of translating between 100+ languages
- Optimized for general-purpose translation
- Provides a good balance between quality and performance
- Default model for most translation tasks

#### NLLB (600M)
- Facebook's No Language Left Behind model
- Specialized in low-resource language pairs
- Enhanced performance for specific language combinations
- Available as an alternative when higher quality is required

### 2. System Initialization
The service initializes its components and prepares for handling translation requests:

### 3. Translation Process
The core translation flow involves several steps:

1. **Request Reception**
   - Client sends translation request to API
   - Request is validated and processed

2. **Model Selection**
   - System determines appropriate model based on:
     - Request parameters
     - Language pair
     - Performance requirements

3. **Translation Processing**
   - Selected model processes the text
   - System records performance metrics
   - Translation is completed

4. **Response Generation**
   - Results are formatted
   - Metrics are included
   - Response is sent to client

### 4. API Layer
The service exposes a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

#### Health Check (`/healthz`)
- Monitors system health and availability
- Provides basic system metrics
- Used for load balancing and monitoring

#### Translation (`/translate`)
- Main translation endpoint
- Accepts POST requests with:
  - Source text
  - Source language code
  - Target language code
  - Optional model type specification
- Returns:
  - Translated text
  - Model information
  - Performance metrics

### 5. Monitoring and Metrics
The system includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

#### Prometheus Integration
- Collects system metrics
- Tracks translation performance
- Monitors resource utilization
- Enables alerting and dashboards

#### Key Metrics
- Translation latency
- Request throughput
- Error rates
- Model-specific performance
- Resource usage

### 6. Deployment Architecture
The system can be deployed in various configurations:
